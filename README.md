# IntroRUzK
Welcome to the R Tutorial IntroRUzK. This package was developed by political scientists at the University of Cologne. 
The aim of the package is to teach R to students with a self-learning module, so they can go through the material on their own computer at their own pace.
The examples in this course are from political science, but no prior knowledge is needed to follow along. 
There are quizzes and coding exercises included in the tutorial, which will be useful to check progress.
Students from the course "Introduction to Quantitative Methods" in the Master programm for Political Science at the University of Cologne can complete a Bonus point assignment on ILIAS to get credit for this course (ignore this if this does not apply to you).

Steps:
1. Download R (https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Download RStudio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
3. Install this tutorial: After opening RStudio type:
devtools::install_github("jenswaeckerle/IntroZUzK")
